# @anivar/mobile-ai-toolkit

On-device AI for React Native. One unified TypeScript API; each method is a thin TurboModule binding to a documented platform framework — Apple Foundation Models / Vision / NaturalLanguage / Speech on iOS, Google ML Kit (incl. ML Kit GenAI on AICore-enabled devices) on Android. Nothing leaves the device, nothing is mocked.

> ## ⚠️ 2.1 Release-Candidate Disclaimer
>
> **The iOS Foundation Models bridge in 2.1.x has not been verified on real Apple Intelligence hardware.** The maintainer does not currently have access to an iPhone 15 Pro / 16 / 17 series device, an Apple Developer account, or a paid macOS CI runner. The Swift code is written against publicly documented Apple API but has only been compile-checked on Linux via the JS / TypeScript / Biome surface — there is no proof the bridge runs end-to-end against the real `SystemLanguageModel`.
>
> **What this means for you:**
> - 2.1.0-rc.x ships under the `next` dist-tag, **not `latest`**. Default `npm install` still pulls the verified 2.0.
> - On Android (ML Kit + ML Kit GenAI), 2.1 is functionally identical to 2.0 — same verified surface.
> - On iOS ≤ 25, 2.1 behaves exactly like 2.0 (rejects generative methods).
> - On iOS 26+ with Apple Intelligence enabled, the new `summarizeText` / `rewriteText` / `generateText` / `chat()` methods *should* route to Foundation Models. They have not been observed doing so on real hardware.
>
> **Help wanted — see [Contributors needed](#contributors-needed-real-device-verification) below.** If you own an Apple-Intelligence-eligible device and want to help cut a verified 2.1.0 GA, even a single bug report would unblock the release.

## Why

A unified surface that hides the iOS/Android split *without* lying about it. Where one platform has a real API and the other doesn't, the call resolves on one side and rejects with `UNSUPPORTED_PLATFORM` / `FEATURE_UNAVAILABLE` on the other — never a polyfill, never a placeholder string. You probe `getDeviceCapabilities()` once, gate UI on the returned feature flags, and write the call site once.

## Install

```bash
npm install @anivar/mobile-ai-toolkit
cd ios && pod install
```

Requires React Native 0.80+ (new architecture / TurboModules), react 19+. Minimum iOS 13, Android API 26.

## Capability matrix

Every method below maps to a real platform call. ✅ = on-device. ⚠️ = on-device when supported by OEM/locale. ❌ = not implemented on that platform; the call rejects with `UNSUPPORTED_PLATFORM`.

| Method | iOS | Android |
|---|---|---|
| `getDeviceCapabilities()` | ✅ — feature probe | ✅ — feature probe |
| `analyzeText(text, opts)` | ✅ NaturalLanguage — sentiment + entities | ✅ ML Kit Language ID + Entity Extraction |
| `extractEntities(text)` | ✅ `NLTagSchemeNameType` | ✅ ML Kit `EntityExtraction` |
| `identifyLanguage(text)` | ✅ `NLLanguageRecognizer` | ✅ ML Kit `LanguageIdentification` |
| `embedText(text)` | ✅ `NLContextualEmbedding` (iOS 17+) | ❌ |
| `analyzeImage(b64, opts)` | ✅ Vision OCR + face rects + iOS 17 foreground mask | ✅ ML Kit text + objects + faces |
| `scanBarcodes(b64)` | ✅ `VNDetectBarcodesRequest` | ✅ ML Kit `BarcodeScanning` |
| `labelImage(b64)` | ✅ `VNClassifyImageRequest` | ✅ ML Kit `ImageLabeling` |
| `describeImage(b64)` | ❌ | ✅ ML Kit GenAI `ImageDescription` *(Beta, AICore)* |
| `segmentPerson(b64)` | ✅ `VNGeneratePersonSegmentationRequest` (iOS 15+) | ✅ ML Kit `SelfieSegmentation` |
| `proofreadText(text)` | ✅ `UITextChecker` *(spelling only)* | ✅ ML Kit GenAI `Proofreader` *(Beta, AICore)* |
| `summarizeText(text, fmt)` | 🧪 Foundation Models *(iOS 26+, Apple Intelligence — unverified, see disclaimer)* | ✅ ML Kit GenAI `Summarizer` *(Beta, AICore)* |
| `rewriteText(text, style)` | 🧪 Foundation Models *(iOS 26+, unverified)* | ✅ ML Kit GenAI `Rewriter` *(Beta, AICore)* |
| `generateText(prompt, opts)` | 🧪 Foundation Models *(iOS 26+, unverified)* | ✅ ML Kit GenAI `Prompt` API *(Beta, Gemini Nano / Gemma 4 via AICore)* |
| `chat(messages, opts)` | 🧪 Foundation Models *(iOS 26+, unverified)* | ✅ ML Kit GenAI `Prompt` API (history flattened to single-shot prompt) |
| `smartReplies(messages)` | ❌ — no public iOS equivalent | ✅ ML Kit `SmartReply` (GA) |
| `translateText(text, src, tgt)` | ❌ — Translation framework bridge tracked for v2.2 | ✅ ML Kit `Translator` (GA, downloads language pack on first use) |
| `transcribeAudioFile(path, opts)` | ✅ `SFSpeechRecognizer` with `requiresOnDeviceRecognition = true` | ⚠️ `SpeechRecognizer` with `EXTRA_PREFER_OFFLINE` (OEM-dependent) |

`getDeviceCapabilities().features` returns a `Record<MethodName, boolean>` map so you can show or hide UI without try/catch.

## Quick start

```ts
import {
  getDeviceCapabilities,
  analyzeText,
  analyzeImage,
  scanBarcodes,
  labelImage,
  segmentPerson,
  summarizeText,
  rewriteText,
  generateText,
  smartReplies,
  translateText,
  transcribeAudioFile,
} from '@anivar/mobile-ai-toolkit';

// 1. Probe once at startup, gate UI on the feature map.
const caps = await getDeviceCapabilities();

// 2. Universal text + image — works on every iOS/Android device.
const analysis = await analyzeText('I really like this app', {
  includeSentiment: true,
  includeEntities: true,
});
// → { language: 'en', sentiment: 0.6, entities: [...], confidence: 0.9 }

const img = await analyzeImage(base64png, { extractText: true, detectFaces: true });
const codes = await scanBarcodes(base64png);
const labels = await labelImage(base64png);
const { maskBase64, width, height } = await segmentPerson(base64png);

// 3. Generative — gate on the feature map.
if (caps.features.summarize) {
  const tldr = await summarizeText(longArticle, 'bullets');
}
if (caps.features.generate) {
  const reply = await generateText('Write a polite decline.', { maxOutputTokens: 80 });
}

// 4. Platform-specific calls reject cleanly when unsupported.
try {
  const replies = await smartReplies([
    { text: 'Want to grab lunch?', fromUser: false, timestampMs: Date.now() },
  ]);
} catch (e) {
  // iOS: { code: 'UNSUPPORTED_PLATFORM' }
}

// 5. On-device transcription.
const t = await transcribeAudioFile('/path/to/clip.m4a', { locale: 'en-US' });
```

### Privacy-mode flag

A boolean stored in the native module. It does not enforce anything by itself — read it from your app code before triggering methods that fetch model assets (e.g. `translateText` downloads a language pack on first use, ML Kit GenAI APIs may pull a model via AICore).

```ts
import { enablePrivateMode, isPrivateModeEnabled } from '@anivar/mobile-ai-toolkit';
enablePrivateMode(true);
```

## Device-class gotchas

- **iOS Foundation Models** (`summarizeText`, `rewriteText`, `generateText`, `chat` on iOS) require iOS 26+ on Apple-Intelligence-eligible hardware (iPhone 15 Pro / Pro Max, every iPhone 16 / 17, M-series iPad / Mac) **and** Apple Intelligence enabled in Settings. On any other configuration these methods reject `FEATURE_UNAVAILABLE` with a precise reason from `SystemLanguageModel.availability`. **The bridge itself is unverified — see the disclaimer at the top.**
- **ML Kit GenAI** (`summarizeText`, `rewriteText`, `proofreadText`, `describeImage`, `generateText`, `chat` on Android) runs only on AICore-enabled devices: Pixel 9+, Samsung S25+, and select 2024–2026 flagships from Xiaomi / OPPO / Honor with locked bootloaders. Pixel 10+ uses Gemma 4 via AICore. On unsupported devices these methods reject with `FEATURE_UNAVAILABLE` — always check `caps.features.<method>` first.
- **iOS on-device speech** (`SFSpeechRecognizer.supportsOnDeviceRecognition`) returns true on most modern devices but can be false for locales whose speech model isn't installed.
- **iOS proofread** uses `UITextChecker` and is spelling-only; the Apple Intelligence Writing Tools rewrite UI has no programmatic invocation API.
- **iOS embeddings** require iOS 17+ and a model loaded for the script of the input (Latin / CJK / Cyrillic / etc.); unsupported scripts reject with `FEATURE_UNAVAILABLE`.
- **`chat()` is single-shot.** Both platforms flatten the message list into one prompt and run a single inference pass — neither vendor exposes a stable persistent-session API across the bridge yet. State lives in *your* JS, not in the native module.

## What's NOT in this package

- **No streaming token callbacks.** Tracked for v2.2 on Android via the Prompt API streaming surface.
- **No iOS translation.** Apple's Translation framework requires SwiftUI host integration; bridge tracked for v2.2.
- **No iOS image description.** Apple's on-device foundation model is text-only; no public `describeImage` equivalent exists. Use `labelImage()` / `analyzeImage()` for visual data.
- **No intent classification.** No public on-device intent-classifier API on either platform that beats a hardcoded keyword matcher.
- **No iOS Writing Tools rewrite.** The system UI can be attached to a `UITextView`, but it has no programmatic API.
- **No cloud fallback.** Out of scope; call your own backend from JS if you need it.

## Contributors needed (real-device verification)

The 2.1 release-candidate ships an unverified Foundation Models bridge because the maintainer doesn't have access to the hardware to test it. **You can help cut a verified 2.1.0 GA in under 10 minutes if you own any of:**

- iPhone 15 Pro / 15 Pro Max
- any iPhone 16 / 16 Plus / 16 Pro / 16 Pro Max
- any iPhone 17 / 17 Pro / 17 Pro Max
- M1+ iPad or any Apple-silicon Mac, on macOS 26+ with Apple Intelligence enabled

**What we need:**

1. Install `@anivar/mobile-ai-toolkit@next` in any RN 0.80+ app on the device above.
2. Confirm Apple Intelligence is enabled in **Settings → Apple Intelligence & Siri**.
3. Run this snippet:
   ```ts
   import { getDeviceCapabilities, generateText, summarizeText, chat } from '@anivar/mobile-ai-toolkit';
   const caps = await getDeviceCapabilities();
   console.log('hasAppleIntelligence:', caps.hasAppleIntelligence);
   console.log('features.generate:', caps.features.generate);
   console.log(await generateText('Write a one-line haiku about TurboModules.', { maxOutputTokens: 60 }));
   console.log(await summarizeText('React Native bridges JS to native code via TurboModules using JSI.', 'one-bullet'));
   console.log(await chat([
     { role: 'system', content: 'You are terse.' },
     { role: 'user', content: 'Why is the sky blue?' },
   ]));
   ```
4. Open an issue at <https://github.com/openslm-ai/mobile-ai-toolkit/issues> with the device model, iOS version, and the four output lines (or the full error stack if it threw).

That's it. Even a single confirmation flips 2.1 from RC to GA. Bug reports are equally valuable — if the bridge is wrong I'd rather know now than have it sit broken for months.

We also welcome:

- **Anyone with a paid macOS CI minute budget** — adding a workflow that does `xcodebuild build -scheme MobileAIToolkitExample -destination "platform=iOS Simulator,OS=26.0"` would catch compile-time regressions on every PR.
- **iOS / Swift devs** willing to review `ios/AIToolkitFoundationModels.swift` for correctness against the documented Foundation Models API.
- **Android / ML Kit GenAI users** with a Pixel 9+ or S25+ — bug reports against the Beta APIs are useful too.

## Roadmap

- **v2.1.0 GA** — gated on at least one community confirmation that the Foundation Models bridge works end-to-end on real hardware. Until then, 2.1.x stays under the `next` dist-tag.
- **v2.2** — Streaming variants of `generateText` / `summarizeText` / `rewriteText` / `chat` (token callbacks) on Android via the Prompt API streaming surface.
- **v2.2** — Apple Translation framework bridge for `translateText` on iOS 18+ via SwiftUI host integration.
